# Challenge Summary
Depth first search

## Challenge Description
Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Approach & Efficiency
The solution should be relatively effective.  It should only have a speed of n, due to one for loop.  And should only take up the space of one because it is only going over one list.  For a total of n.
