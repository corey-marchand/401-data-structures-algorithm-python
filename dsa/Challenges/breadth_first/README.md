# Challenge Summary
Breadth first search
## Challenge Description
Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
I traveresed through the graph using breadth first.  The solution should be effective due to only having one for loop which shouuld only take up the time amount on n.  Space only takes up 1, with a total of b big o time complexity.
