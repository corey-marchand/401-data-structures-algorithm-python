# Challenge Summary
code challenge 3

## Challenge Description
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
This solution will not be the most effective, though it will be somewhat effective.  It for loops over an array which will take up the time O(n) and it does not store anything so it will only have a total of O(n).
