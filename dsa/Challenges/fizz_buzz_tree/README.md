# Challenge Summary
Code Challenge - FizzBuzz
## Challenge Description
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.  Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3,5, or both.  If divisible by three, return fizz.  If divisible by 5, return buzz. If divisible by 3 and 5, return FizzBuzz.

## Approach & Efficiency
I made a recursive solution to shorten up the code and make it extremely effective.  It checks for node values and if they are divisible by three or five then replace those with the corresponding words.  Then the function calls itself twice with both node.left and node.right
